# TCX-Interface
This [project](https://zodiacpoolsystems.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/STG/pages/1469644835/Project+-+TCX+Interface) aims to enable test team members to automate physical interaction with the TCX Command Hub system.

The code is hosted partially local and on the cloud - TCXAction.py is the lambda code and main.py is hosted locally.
